            <p>Hi! Welcome to my website! I am Zhendan Shang</p>

            <p>I am a Geophysicist (2:1 BSc Geophysics from Imperial) currently completing a Masters in Applied Computational Science and Engineering. </p>

            <p>I built this website using HTML, CSS and Javascript (sadly Github pages does not let me use Angular or php) to showcase my various projects and interests. </p>

        </div>

      <p>I write code to solve scientific problems using numerical simulations. I use Python (numpy, matplotlib, PyTorch etc.) for visualizations and machine learning, C++ (OpenMP, MPI etc.) for Parallelization and memory managements and Fortran with BLAS and LAPACK for complicated matrix algebra. 

      <p>While I am proficient in using pillow, matplotlib and gnuplot for visualization, I can also "prettify" these images using GIMP, Inkscape and Photoshop for final presentation. </p>

      <p>I also built computers to do hardware optimization for my projects. No, I don't go to the mountains or beaches to mine bauxite, chalcopyrite, hematite or silicates; though I have done fieldwork in Alicante, Cyprus and Dorset. Note to self: Airport security gets really confused when they see large groups of people each carrying different rocks, and each having a rock breaking tools. I select and assemble CPU, GPU, etc. together to make compute nodes and if I have the budget I link the nodes together to form a clusters. I usually run small simulations on my own clusters to check for robustness and stability before using them on proper HPCs </p>

      <p>I have native fluency in English, Romanian and Mandarin and I am trying my best to remember French. Learning new human languages is the 2nd priority on my to do list, behind learning other programming languages. </p>

      <p> If you've read until here, and if you appreciate my dry sense of humour, then I am really appreciative of your time spent! </p>
