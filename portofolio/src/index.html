<p> Hi! Welcome to my website! I am Zhendan Shang </p>

<p> I am a Geophysicist (2:1 BSc Geophysics from Imperial) currently completing a Masters in Applied Computational Science and Engineering. </p>

<p>I built this website using HTML, CSS and Angular and hosted it on Github pages with a custom domain name to showcase my various projects and interests. </p>

<p> I write code to solve scientific problems using numerical simulations. I use Python (numpy, matplotlib, PyTorch etc.) for visualizations and machine learning, C++ (OpenMP, MPI etc.) for Parallelization and memory managements and Fortran with BLAS and LAPACK for complicated matrix algebra. </p>

<p> While I am proficient in using pillow, matplotlib and gnuplot for visualization, I can also "prettify" these images using GIMP, Inkscape and Photoshop for final presentation. </p>

<p> I also built computers to do hardware optimization for my projects. No, I don't go to the mountains or beaches to mine bauxite, chalcopyrite, hematite or silicates; though I have done fieldwork in Alicante, Cyprus and Dorset. I select and assemble CPU, GPU, etc. together to make compute nodes.  </p>

<p> I have native fluency in English, Romanian and Mandarin and I am trying my best to remember French. Learning new human languages is the 2nd priority on my to do list, behind learning programming languages.  </p>

<p> I am also a casual video gamer and nowhere near close to competitive capability. My favorite genre are RTS and RPG games and I am particularly picky about games of these genres. I also sometimes make small mods to improve my general experience. </p>
