Hi! Welcome to my site! I am Zhendan Shang

I built this website with HTML, CSS and Angular and hosted the website on Github Pages with a custom domain name to showcase my various projects and interests. 

I have a 2:1 BSc Geophysics from Imperial and I will be finishing my MSc in Applied Computational Science and Engineering also from Imperial in September 2021. 

I solve scientific questions with numerical simulations using Python (with numpy, scipy, matplotlib for visualization and ML), using C++ (with OpenMP, MPI for parallelization and memory management) amd Fortran(for complicated matrix operations). I usually use a simple markdown readme file for simple snippets of code, but I also write LaTeX documents for large projects involving lots of math. 

While I am proficient with working on image manipulation using pillow or matplotlib from Python, I do the proper image "prettification" using GIMP, Inkscape and Photoshop

I also build computers from scratch to tackle big problems. No, I don't go to the mountains or oceans to mine chalcopyrite for the cooler, bauxite for the case or silicates for the microchips. However, I do assemble computer components into fully functional computers and try to optimize the software from the hardware up. 

I have native fluency in English, Romanian and Mandarin, ad I am trying my very best to remember French. Learning other languages is also on my very long to-learn list

I am also a video gamer, though only casual one at best, and no where close to a competitive player. My belief is that I play the game, and not the game plays me. My favorite genre are RTS or grand strategy games, and I sometimes create small mods to spice up my experience.
